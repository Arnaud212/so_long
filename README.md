# So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!

## Project Summary
This project is about creating a simple 2D game in C using the MiniLibX graphics library. The objective is to navigate a character on a 2D map, collect all the items, and reach the exit. This project helps you practice window management, event handling, and texture usage.

## Objectives
- Create a 2D game with a character that moves on a map.
- Use the MiniLibX library for graphics management.
- Implement item collection and movement mechanics.
- Ensure smooth window handling and proper memory management.

## Main Rules
- Write the project in C following the Norm.
- Use MiniLibX for graphics management.
- Properly manage memory allocations.
- Provide a Makefile to compile the project.
- Character movement is controlled by the W, A, S, D keys.

## How to Use the Project

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the MiniLibX library installed.
- Clone the project repository to your machine.

### Compilation
- Use the provided Makefile to compile the project:
  ```bash
  make
  ```
### Running the Game

To run the game, use the following command with a map file in `.ber` format:
```sh
./so_long map.ber
```
